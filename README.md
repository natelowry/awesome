The Awesome jQuery Plugin

Want to add some awesome to your site?  Can't find the words?  Now you can!

$("#myDiv").awesome() will replace the text with an awesome word from the list.  

Want to add your own words?  Go for it!  Just append them to the 'awesomes' array.

These are based on mrichardson23's Awesome Button project for Arduino.  Check it out too.
